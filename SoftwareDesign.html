<p>
The size of the ship is how many cells it takes up aswell as how many hits it can take. <br>
Each Ship object will also have a <b>hit</b> and a <b> location </b> property.
<br>
<ul><li>
<b>hit</b> a counter for how many hits the ship has taken
</li><li>
<b>location</b> a 2D array which has the location for the ship. 
</li></ul>
</p>

<h4>Grids</h3>

<p>
The computer and the player each have a grid which will have the location of their ships.<br>
Here is an example: <br>
<tt>PlayerGrid: {{0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0}, {0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,}, {0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}};</tt>
<br> 
<br>
Each player also has a grid which will show if a cell has been hit by the other player, and if that hit was successful or not. <br>
Here is an example:<br>
<tt>PlayerCompGrid : {{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0}, {0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0}, {0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}};</tt>
</p>

<p>
